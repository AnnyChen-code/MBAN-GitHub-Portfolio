# Hi, I'm Yifei Chen 👋  
**MBAN Candidate @ UBC Sauder | Analytics and Optimization | Marketing Science | Data Storytelling**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m really happy you’re here! It means you’re curious about my work, my journey, and the things I’ve been building~ I love connecting with people who enjoy data, problem-solving, and continuous learning just as much as I do, so thank you for taking the time to get to know me!!!!!

I am a highly driven and detail-oriented analytics professional with a reputation for fast learning, clear communication, and a calm, reliable working style. I bring a strong mix of analytical rigor, structured thinking, and genuine curiosity, paired with a proactive mindset that helps teams move forward and solve problems efficiently. Known for being thoughtful, collaborative, and receptive to feedback, I naturally take the lead in organizing work, clarifying ambiguity, and ensuring projects are delivered with accuracy and intention. My work ethic is defined by high standards, consistency, and a deep sense of responsibility — I care about doing things correctly and making sure the people around me feel supported.

I am currently in the UBC Master of Business Analytics (MBAN) program, building end-to-end analytics, optimization, and data science projects. My interests sit at the intersection of data, business, and marketing, where I enjoy turning complex data into clear recommendations that make sense to real stakeholders.

My portfolio includes text analytics on 10-K filings, customer loyalty modeling, segmentation and conjoint analysis, perceptual and preference mapping, school-bus routing optimization, medical supply allocation, and network shortest-path modeling. Skilled in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Gurobi, I deliver full-cycle analytics work: data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, visualization, and managerial interpretation. Altogether, my technical foundation, leadership mindset, and collaborative personality make me a strong, well-rounded candidate who contributes both analytical depth and positive team impact.
